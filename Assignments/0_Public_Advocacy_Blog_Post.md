## Public Advocacy Blog Post Assignment

**Sign-up sheet at https://goo.gl/6uZY62**

Please note that once you pick a due date for your blog post, **this due date will be enforced for grading purposes**, so please be sure to create a reminder for yourself to ensure that it does not fall out of view as the semester goes along.

The purpose of this assignment is to give you some practice in summarizing the results of work that you are interested in (or your own work) for a broader, less technical audience. This consists of two components:
1. Compose a concise, persuasive, yet accessible essay on a topic of your choosing, appropriate for the general public or a more particular non-academic audience. We will post this on the **public** class blog (http://blogs.ischool.berkeley.edu/w231/blog/), either with your name for attribution or anonymized (your choice, please specify). 
2. Prepare an "elevator pitch" (as in, something you'd be able to deliver to someone in the time it takes to take an elevator) with 1-2 key lessons/takeaways from your blog post. No slides, please! We'll also share a link to your blog post as well. (The "elevator pitch" is a useful skill; it's good practice to be able to distill the key points you want to make into a brief statement! Also consider either starting or ending your blog post with this pitch.)

You can look at these examples as models for what we would like. If you look back through the archives of the #w231-announce channel, there are many examples posted there!
* Posts on an academic blog (Crooked Timber, Concurring Opinions, Culture Digitally, etc.)
* Discussion-based list services (AoIR, IP, IDC, Nettime, etc.) or op/ed venues (Huffington Post, Chronicle of Higher Education, Slate, New York Times, etc.)
* Internal or professional-oriented company blogs, magazines, or newsletters; or compositions for civic engagement (such as a public FTC comment)

The topic should be of general interest, but grounded in legal, ethical, or policy-based issues relevant to data science and/or discussions from class. You **may** choose to write your blog piece on the same topic as your final project; this would give you a chance to practice communicating your findings to different audiences. If you choose not to write your piece on your final project topic, you can use this blog post as an opportunity to expand on issues your found relevant and interesting in class. In this case, focusing your blog post and discussion around a current issue/debate (what journalists would call a "hook") is strongly preferred. Finally, while you should build your argument on established theory and evidence, inline citations are not required, though hyperlinks are suggested as a way to make your discussion connected to current conversations on your chosen topic. Please review the [Writing Practices](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/w231/blob/master/README.md#writing-practices) section of the syllabus for more detail about expectations for your writing in this course.

Your essay should be around 500-750+ words, and include 2-3 pictures. Completed posts in .txt, .html (NOT auto-generated!), or .md and web-compatible image files should be **submitted to ISVC.** Please choose descriptive names for your images - either your name or (if you want to anonymize your post) a descriptive phrase of what the image contains.

All blog posts will be visible to general public to encourage education and debate in this field. You have a choice whether you would like to put your name as an author as a way to show off your hard work, but you can also opt to anonymize it - please indicate as much in your post.

### Grading Rubric

Description | Exceptional | Good | Needs Work
-|-|-|-
Use of Course Materials | Thoroughly and carefully applies course materials to the chosen topic. Application of the materials is appropriate to the topic, and clearly defined/described for a lay audience. | Integrates course materials, but misses opportunities to connect additional material that is clearly relevant to the topic and argument. Integration may be missing nuance or detail. | Cursory or incorrect use of course materials.
Topic Choice | Topic is original, carefully described, and compellingly presented. Connections to course materials are natural and insightful. Includes an explanation of why the author finds the topic compelling. | Topic isn't well-motivated, and connections to course materials seem somewhat contrived. | Little or no connection between topic chosen and course materials.
Concrete Evidence | Provides persuasive concrete evidence for claims. | Does not consistently provide concrete evidence. | Fails to provide concrete evidence (e.g. states opinions with no backing). 
Use of Images | Chooses images that are eye-catching and relevant to the topic. Images add to the analysis. | Images are compelling but not as relevant to the topic. | One or both images are missing (or not submitted as separate files, so we couldn't post them). 
Clarity of writing | Clearly organized and persuasive writing. Uses a conversational/journalistic tone appropriate for public-facing writing. | Some difficulties following the argument, not as concise as it could be. | Very hard to follow argument; either lots of filler or much too short/underdeveloped.
