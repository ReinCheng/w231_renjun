## Applications of the Belmont Principles 

Consider one of the following case studies (linked below) or another topic of your choice through the lens of the Belmont Report. Building on our conversation in class, you should analyze your chosen case using *all three* values cited in the Belmont Report (Respect, Beneficence, and Justice). 

Write a response explaining how you think the Belmont Report relates to these ethical situations. Summarize your understanding of the principles you feel are relevant or not, and support your opinions. In addition, you may also want to consider any limits or insufficiencies with the Belmont Report for addressing the example you choose. Finally, feel free to incorporate other readings (especially helpful if you are exploring the limits of either the case or the application of the Belmont Report).

The response should be **300 to 350 words**. Given the length constraints, it is important (and more challenging than you may think) to be concise, so allocate your time appropriately. If you cite additional readings, you may use any standard style guide for your citations (though APA style is preferred). Please review the [Writing Practices](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/w231/blob/master/README.md#writing-practices) section of the syllabus for more detail about expectations for your writing in this course.
