## Privacy Policy Assignment

#### Overview

Please pick a service you use frequently or are very familiar with (i.e Uber, Fitbit, Facebook, LinkedIn, Zoom, 2U, etc.) and read its terms of service/privacy policy (some cover both of these in one document, others have multiple). Then, analyze what you've read through the lens of the three privacy frameworks we've learned about in class: Solove's Taxonomy, Nissenbaum's Contextual Integrity, and Mulligan et al.'s analytic, and write up your results. Use the questions below to help structure your writeup.
* We don't have a strict word limit or length requirement on this assignment, but find that typical assignments in the past have run 5-7+ pages double-spaced. We do ask that like in the first assignment, you work on being concise and persuasive. Think about how to most clearly make the case you want to make. Please review the [Writing Practices](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/w231/blob/master/README.md#writing-practices) section of the syllabus for more detail about expectations for your writing in this course.
* In your writeup include at the top your name, the name of the website and a link to the privacy policy/terms of service. 

*Please also prepare a very brief presentation* (5 minutes max) of your results. Be concise! Stick with the key messages you want to get across - what was most surprising and how it fares in light of the privacy frameworks we've studied <!--, and how users reacted via UserTesting-->. Please prepare a few (3-5) slides to accompany your presentation. We will be presenting these in class. The purpose of this presentation is to work on being comfortable talking about these frameworks to an audience. Note, however, that your performance in this presentation is NOT a part of your grade, so please don't stress about this! We hope this is a safe place to practice a skill that some may find to be challenging, but is a common part of being a data scientist and also important for doing advocacy work. If you would rather pre-record your presentation instead of presenting live, please let us know and we can accommodate that instead.

Please submit papers and slides **via ISVC.** We strongly prefer PDFs.

#### Assignment

In reading your terms of service and/or privacy policy, pay particular attention to the sections on data collection and usage terms. Utilize the three privacy frameworks we've learned about in class - Solove's Taxonomy, Nissenbaum's Contextual Integrity, and Mulligan et al.'s analytic - to document what this policy says. Use the following questions to guide your examination of it and your writeup:

1. In terms of scope, what does it cover? What does it not cover? Was there anything that was interesting and/or surprising?
2. Regarding the sections on data collection and usage, what is being said? What do you think this actually means in practice, and what would be your expectations from this document?
3. What are you giving consent to? Are there any options describe for recourse, or deleting/removing data/following up on data errors?
4. Regarding the sections related to data collection, analysis and sharing, how do they describe and talk about uses of data?
5. From what you have been learning so far, what legal/ethical questions and concerns come up? How are they addressed in the document?
6. Thinking about your expectations and context of use, how do they align with what you read?
7. What would you want to see in this and how would you want it to be presented? What are the limitations of the current format, and how does it address expectations that a user may have about the use of the product or service?

After you have had a chance to look through the terms you have chosen, please take a look at the following frameworks for notice and consent provided by both the DOJ and FTC. How do these line up with you what you just read? Please be sure to discuss both of them in your writeup.
  * [FTC Principles circa 2012](https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/reports/federal-trade-commission-report-protecting-consumer-privacy-era-rapid-change-recommendations/120326privacyreport.pdf)
  * [CALOPPA (look over Highlights of Recommendations list on page 2 of executive summary)](https://oag.ca.gov/sites/all/files/agweb/pdfs/cybersecurity/making_your_privacy_practices_public.pdf)

<!--#### What do other people think about the terms?

Create a short online survey and **ask 2-3 friends or family members** (NOT students or alums of this class, please!) to go through the Privacy Policy and Terms and Conditions that you selected and see what they think. Include a summary of these results in your writeup. 
Here are some standard questions that you can use for your survey. Feel free to use what is below, construct your own, or modify what is below to your own interests.
* What do you think is in this privacy policy?
* Go to and read through the following sections (Provide them sections to look at x, y, z). 
  * For each section - what did it say?
  * Is this different than your expectations? How?
  * Does this change the way youâ€™d think about using the service/app/etc? Why or why not?
* What would you like to see? Why? -->

### Grading Rubric

Description | Exceptional | Good | Needs Work
-|-|-|-
Background | Clearly summarizes organization (e.g. writing style, format, etc.) and context (e.g. where they are found, how users encounter them) of privacy policy and/or TOS (and/or other relevant documents - this varies by company), highlights any surprises or omissions (what it doesn't cover but maybe should). | Gives somewhat cursory or incomplete information on the content and context of relevant documents. | Little or no description of relevant documents, does not identify surprises or omissions.
Privacy Frameworks | Detailed analysis using all components of all three privacy frameworks (Solove, Nissenbaum, and Mulligan et al.'s privacy analytic). | Applies all aspects of Solove, Nissenbaum, and/or the privacy analytic in a more cursory way. | Misuses or omits discussion of large parts of privacy frameworks, or entire frameworks.
Synthesis | Clearly connects specific parts of the privacy policy and other relevant documents to specific parts of the privacy frameworks; strong connections between the ideas in the frameworks and the relevant documents (and company practices, as appropriate). Provides a holistic view of the company's practices with regards to each privacy framework, as reflected in the privacy policy or other relevant documents. Traces practices of data collection/usage/sharing, as well as the scope of consent and recourse for deletion/correction. | Connects parts of the privacy policy and other relevant documents to the privacy frameworks, but lacks specificity/context or misses potential connections to course materials. Some discussion of practices of data collection/usage, consent, and recourse, but some context or detail may be missing. | Connections between the relevant documents and the privacy frameworks lack detail or are misapplied. Does not specifically address practices of data collection/usage/sharing, consent, and recourse.
Evaluation | Includes discussion about differences in what the author expected vs. what they encountered, limitations of the policy's current format, what concerns the author has based on their analysis, whether these concerns are addressed, and what the author would like to see changed. | Cursory treatment of these questions. | Missing one or more of these questions.
FTC/CalOPPA | Incorporates a discussion of both the FTC Principles and CapOPPA into an analysis of the company's notice-and-consent practices. | Includes a cursory mention of FTC and/or CalOPPA. | Does not include FTC or CalOPPA in analysis.
Concrete Evidence | Provides persuasive concrete evidence for claims. | Does not consistently provide concrete evidence, but provides some. | Fails to provide concrete evidence (e.g. states opinions with no backing). 
Clarity of writing | Clearly organized and persuasive writing. Clear "signposting" throughout the writeup (e.g. providing a clear summary of main points at the end of the introduction, including a conclusion that re-states main points) to guide the reader through the main argument(s).  | Some difficulties following the argument, not as concise as it could be. | Very hard to follow argument; either lots of filler or much too short/underdeveloped.
