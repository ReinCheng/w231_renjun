## Peer Feedback Assignment

It is common in many data science positions to be asked to offer feedback on peers' work. Whether it's a code review, comments on a working document, a data or model audit, or other forms, these requests for feedback are not only opportunities to comment on the technical soundness of your peers' work, but on the ethical implications, using the kinds of frameworks and evidence we have been studying in this class. Studies of ethical practices in technology companies suggest that people don't always speak up about concerns because they feel that it is best left to the 'experts.' However, we hope that the practice you get in this peer feedback assignment, along with the other writing assignments in this class, demonstrates that you *do* have the skills and knowledge to offer this kind of commentary!

The purpose of this feedback assignment is two-fold. It:
1. Offers additional constructive feedback on your final project ideas 
2. Gives you an opportunity to think through the ideas we've addressed in an applied context (i.e., your classmates' projects). 

Please include in your feedback:
* A brief summary of what you believe to be the project's primary focus and objective(s).
* A statement about what you see as the project's value and its strengths (i.e., its usefulness, practical applications, contribution to broader conversations, etc.). 
* At least three points of constructive criticism around some potential areas for improvement, either in content or clarity. This could be more connections to class content, other connections or references the authors might find useful, another perspective on what the authors have stated, etc.

*The trickiest part to navigate -- but so important to practice -- is the **constructive criticism.** While critically assessing your peers' projects, try to present your feedback in productive ways. If you feel that a certain concept or resource is missing from the discussion, point it out - but also articulate why and how you think it might contribute to your classmates' work. If you disagree with an assumption or a point, make a note of that - but also note why you think the disagreement is important and how you think your classmate could start to address your concerns. In short: **feedback should aim to make a project stronger, not tear it down.** Criticism is an exceptionally good thing when leveled in constructive ways. Please remember our overall course commitment to [being a good team player](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/w231/blob/master/README.md#statement-of-diversity-and-inclusion).*
  
### Form and Formatting

Your feedback should be at least 400 words for each outline you are assigned. If you cite additional readings, you may use any standard style guide for your citations (e.g. APA or Chicago style) - this will make it easier for your classmates to locate the relevant texts. 

### Where to find Assignments and Outlines

You will be assigned two of your peers' project outlines, and these assignments will be posted on [Slack](https://app.slack.com/client/T0WA5NWKG/C6WKWFVR6). All project outlines will be placed in a zip file in the [Assignments directory](https://github.com/UC-Berkeley-I-School/w231/tree/master/Assignments). 

### Grading Rubric

Description | Exceptional | Good | Needs Work
-|-|-|-
Summary of Project | Provides a clear and concise distillation of the project. | Provides a summary of the project, but misses some aspect of the author's stated goals. | Fails to provide a summary of the project.
Positive Feedback | Provides one or more compelling and generous statements about the value and potential for the project. | Provides a positive statement that may be somewhat generic. | Fails to provide a statement about the potential for the project.
Constructive Criticism | Provides at least three concrete and actionable ideas for developing or improving the project. | Provides at least three ideas for developing or improving the project, but they lack specificity or it is unclear how to implement them. | Does not provide three ideas.
Concrete Evidence | Provides persuasive concrete evidence for claims. | Does not consistently provide concrete evidence, but provides some. | Fails to provide concrete evidence (e.g. states opinions with no backing). 
Succintness | Clearly organized and persuasive writing, solidly above minimum requested (excluding references). | Above minimum requested (excluding references), but some difficulties following the argument. | Far from minimum requested, very hard to follow argument.

### Submitting your completed feedback

Unlike other assignments, your completed feedback document should be **submitted via Slack to your assigned feedback partner(s) AND ALL instructors/teaching assistants**. Most students are findable if you start to type their name in Slack; please reach out if you have any trouble. As always, your instructors' email addresses are available on the course syllabus.

*This is the shortest turnaround time for an assignment in the semester, but we want these to be done with plenty of time for everyone to gain the maximum value from your constructive feedback and include as many applicable enhancements as possible.*
