## Course Description:
This course provides an introduction to the legal, policy, and ethical implications of data. We examine how these issues arise throughout the full data lifecycle, from collection, to storage, processing, analysis and use, with a focus on real-world implications and case studies. Topics include privacy, classification, surveillance, fairness, discrimination, decisional autonomy, and duties to warn or act. Case studies include criminal justice, national security, personal and public health, marketing, civic surveillance, politics, education, employment, and more. We discuss technical, legal, and market approaches to mitigating and managing discrete and compound sets of concerns, and explore the strengths and benefits of competing and complementary approaches. **Prerequisites:** Students should complete MIDS courses 201 and 203 before enrolling in this course.

## Course Evaluation:
* Participation (25%)
  * Synchronous session discussion (15%). Attend and actively participate in every synchronous session. If you must miss a synchronous session, please let us know and we can send you a copy of the breakout prompt from that week, which you can fill out for credit. You can also watch the synch session later, but this doesn't capture the breakout sessions and doesn't include the breakout prompt.
  * Asynchronous participation (10%). This class relies on readings and asynch content. Both are necessary for the synch session, and are important for the course. Complete both before the synch session each week. ISVC tracks videos watched and we look through (though do not comment on) your responses to questions, and together those constitute your asynchronous participation grade.
